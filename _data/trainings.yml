      (Available as hybrid - in Person or online)

      This three-day hands-on course teaches penetration testers and developers how to analyse Android and iOS applications for security vulnerabilities by going through the different phases of testing, including dynamic testing, static analysis, reverse engineering and Software Composition Analysis (SCA), using the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG). The OWASP MASTG is a comprehensive and open source guide to mobile security testing for both iOS and Android, providing a methodology and very detailed technical test cases to ensure completeness and using the latest attack techniques against mobile applications. This course will give you hands-on experience with open source tools and advanced methodologies by guiding you through real-world scenarios.
      <br>
      Detailed outline<br>
      <br>
      We'll start the first day with an introduction to the OWASP MASVS and MASTG and the latest updates to it and then dive into the Android platform and its security architecture. Students will no longer be required to bring their own Android device, instead each student will be provided with a cloud-based virtualised Android device from Corellium. Topics include<br>
      <br>
      <li>Intercepting network traffic from apps written in mobile app frameworks such as Google's Flutter</li>
      <li>Reverse engineering a Kotlin app and identifying and exploiting a real-world deep link vulnerability through manual source code review</li>
      <li>Explore the differences and effectiveness of reverse engineering Android apps using Smali patching, Magisk and Dynamic Instrumentation with Frida</li>
      <li>Frida crash course to get started with dynamic instrumentation on Android apps<li>
      <li>Bypass different implementations of SSL pinning using Frida<li>
      <li>Use dynamic instrumentation with Frida to Bypass multiple root detection mechanisms</li>
      Day 1 will be closed with a Capture the Flag (CTF)<br>
      <br>
      On day 2 we wrap up Android and start with iOS and we will use a Github repo to trigger static scanning, SCA and secret scanning on Kotlin and Swift<br>
      <br>
      Android<br>
      <br>
      <li>Analyse the storage of an Android app and understand the various options on how and where files can be stored (app-specific, shared storage etc.)

      <li>Demonstration on how to test watchOS apps and it's limitations</li>
      <br>
      Day 3 focuses on iOS. We will begin the day by creating an iOS test environment using Corellium and dive into several topics, including<br>
      <br>
      <li>Intercepting network traffic of an iOS App in various scenarios, including intercepting traffic that is not HTTP</li>
      <li>Examining stateless authentication (JWT) in a mobile app</li>

      <li>Testing methodology with a non-jailbroken device by repackaging an IPA with the Frida gadget</li>
      <li>Using Frida to bypass runtime instrumentation of iOS applications</li>
      <li>Anti-Jailbreaking Mechanisms</li>
      <li>Frida's detection mechanism</li><br>
      <br>
      We'll wrap up the final day with a "Mobile Hacking Scavenger Hunt." This unique CTF will feature not just mobile apps but also physical art objects, which we refer to as "hackable artworks".<br>
      <br>
      Whether you are a beginner who wants to learn mobile app testing from the ground up, or an experienced pentester or developer who wants to improve your existing skills to perform more advanced attack techniques, or just for fun, this training will help you achieve your goals.<br>
      <br>
      The course consists of many different labs developed by the instructor and is approximately 65% hands-on and 35% lecture.<br>
      <br>
      Upon successful completion of this course, students will have a better understanding of how to test for vulnerabilities in mobile applications, how to suggest the right mitigation techniques to developers, and how to perform tests consistently.<br>
      <br>
      What students should bring<br>
      <br>
      The following requirements must be met by students in order to be able to follow all exercises and participate fully<br>

  Description: >-
      Based on the updated Black Hat edition 2024 training, you will be challenged with hands-on threat modeling exercises based on real-world projects. You will get insight into our practical industry experience, helping you to become a Threat Modeling Practitioner. We included an exercise on MITRE ATT&CK, and we focus on embedding threat modeling in Agile and DevOps practices. And we introduce a new challenge on threat modeling a Machine Learning-Powered Chatbot.<br>
      <br>
      We levelled up the threat modeling war game. Engaged in CTF-style challenges, your team will battle for control over an offshore wind turbine park.<br>
      <br>
      The level of this training is Beginner/Intermediate. Participants who are new to threat modeling are advised to follow our self-paced Threat Modeling Introduction training (which is about 2 hours and is included in this training.<br>
      <br>
      As highly skilled professionals with years of experience under our belts, we're intimately familiar with the gap between academic knowledge of threat modeling and real-world practice. To minimize that gap, we have developed practical use cases, based on real-world projects. Each use case includes a description of the environment, together with questions and templates to build a threat model.<br>
      <br>
      Students will be challenged in groups of 3 to 4 people to perform the different stages of threat modeling<br>
      <br>
      <li>Diagram techniques applied on a travel booking service</li>
      <li>Threat model a cloud-based update service for an IoT kiosk</li>
      <li>Create an attack tree against a nuclear research facility</li>
      <li>Create a SOC Risk Based Alerting system with MITRE ATT&CK</li>
      <li>Mitigate threats in a payment service build with microservices and S3 buckets</li>
      <li>Threat modeling a Machine Learning-Powered Chatbot</li>
      <li>Apply the OWASP Threat Modeling Playbook on agile development</li>
      <li>Threat modeling the CI/CD pipeline</li>
      <li>Battle for control over "Zwarte Wind", an offshore wind turbine park</li><br>
      <br>
      <br>After each hands-on exercise, the results are discussed, and students receive a documented solution.<br>
      <br>
      <br>As part of this training, you will be asked to create and submit your own threat model, on which you will get individual feedback.<br>
      <br>
      <br>All participants get our Threat Modeling Playbook to improve you threat modeling practice, one-year access to our online threat modeling learning platform, and one-hour personal coaching to refine your threat modeling.<br>
