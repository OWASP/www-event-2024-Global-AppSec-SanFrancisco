  Description: >-
      The 2021 OWASP Top Ten introduced a category “Insecure Design” to focus on risks related to design flaws. In this training, we will focus on building defense-in-depth software. What can we do to proactively architect software to be more resilient to attacks? What type of findings may not be discovered via automated static analysis? How can we design our software to be more friendly during incident response scenarios?

      This one-day training is perfect for engineers as well as security practitioners that have some familiarity with the OWASP top 10. During this training, we will focus on identifying often-overlooked architectural anti-patterns and vulnerabilities to be on the lookout for. We will utilize source code review to analyze patterns for improvement in both real-world applications as well as intentionally vulnerable applications. Every interactive exercise will involve discovering concerns and writing code to engineer solutions. The course will wrap up with real-world vulnerability analysis of open-source software with an effort to help provide more secure architectural recommendations for these projects.


      Engineers will leave this training with a solid understanding of defense-in-depth software architecture and design. Security engineers or consultants can expect to leave with an increased understanding of insecure design patterns and vulnerabilities.<br>

  Description: >-
       You bought the application security tools, you have the findings, but now what? Many organizations find themselves drowning in “possible vulnerabilities”, struggling to streamline their processes and not sure how to measure their progress.

        If you are involved in using SAST, DAST or SCA tools in your organization, these may be familiar feelings to you. In this course you will learn how to address these problems and more (in a vendor-neutral way), with topics including:
        <ul>
        <li>What to expect from these tools?</li>
        <li>Customizing and optimizing these tools effectively</li>
        <li>Building tool processes which fit your business</li>
        <li>Automating workflows using CI/CD without slowing it down.</li>
        <li>Showing the value and improvements you are making</li>
        <li>Faster and easier triage through smart filtering</li>
        <li>How to focus on fixing what matters and cut down noise</li>
        <li>Techniques for various alternative forms of remediation</li>
        <li>Building similar processes for penetration testing activities.</li>
        <li>Comparison of the different tool types covered.</li>
        </ul>
        To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams on table-top exercises where you design processes to cover specific scenarios, explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders and practice prioritizing your remediation efforts.
        
        For these exercises, you will work based on specially designed process templates (which we will provide) which you can use afterwards to apply these improvements within your own organization.
        
        Be ready to work in a group, take part in discussions and present your findings and leave the course with clear strategies and ideas on how to get less stress and more value from these tools.

  SectionId: sku_IWAHBB
  Description: >- 
        The threat modeling training based on real life hands-on practical threat modeling, and delivered every year at OWASP since 2016, and Black Hat since 2017. Our latest Black Hat training score was 4.7/5 with great feedback!.
        <br>
        In this edition we enhanced the section on privacy by design, compliance, and added a section on threat modeling medical
        devices. All participants get our Threat Modeling Playbook plus one year access to our online threat modeling learning platform. As part of this training, you will be asked to create your own threat model, on which you will get individual feedback. One month after the training we organize an online review session with all the participants.
        <br>
        As highly skilled professionals with years of experience under our belts, we’re intimately familiar with the gap between academic knowledge of threat modeling and real-world practice. To minimize that gap, we have developed practical use cases, based on real-life projects. Each use case includes a description of the environment, together with questions and templates to build a threat model.
        <br>
        Using this methodology for the hands-on workshops we provide our students with a challenging training experience and the templates to incorporate threat modeling best practices in their daily work. Students will be challenged in groups of 3 to 4 people to perform the different stages of threat modeling on the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Diagramming web and mobile applications, sharing the same REST
        backend</li>
        <li>Threat modeling an IoT gateway with a cloud-based update service</li>
        <li>Get into the defender's head - modeling points of attack against a
        nuclear facility</li>
        <li>Threat mitigations of OAuth scenarios for an HR application</li>
        <li>Privacy analysis of a new face recognition system in an airport</li>
        </ul>

        After each hands-on workshop, the results are discussed, and
        students receive a documented solution. Based on our successful
        trainings in the last years and the great and positive feedback, we
        release this updated threat modeling training at Global AppSec San
        Francisco 2022.
        <br>
        <strong>Course Outline</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Threat modeling introduction</li>
        <li>Diagrams – what are you building?</li>
