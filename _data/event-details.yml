    **THE MUST ATTEND EVENT FOR CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS**<br>
    <br>
    This year we are doing things a little differently....<br>
    <br>
    OWASP is pleased to invite you to our Global AppSec US Conference.  This year we will have MORE networking opportunities, a NEW track for mentorship, NEW sponsorship opportunities, AND unveiling our newest extension of the conference, Developer Day (separate ticket purchase) on September 25th. If you want to send your developers to a conference where they can explore application security and get started on their journey to being a security championâ€¦ but not sure send them? DevDays at OWASP Global AppSec SF is exactly this. Explore and learn how to code more securely and how to not let security get in the way of ship it fast. Collaborate with other developers, security practitioners, industry talent and more to enrich and grow your skills at OWASP DevDays. Learn more and see the Dev Day Agenda here - https://developerdays.globalappsec.org/!<br>
    <br>
    Join us for the newly designed OWASP Global AppSec US Conference alongside 1200+ cybersecurity experts from September 23-27 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco in San Francisco, CA. <br>
    <br>
    Immerse yourself in thought-provoking presentations by globally renowned keynote speakers, choose from our diverse array of five tracks ranging in focus from OWASP Projects to tracks aimed at your particular field of interest such as builder/developer, breaker, defender, and manager-culture. Other opportunities include exploring the exhibitor hall, participating in the Meet the Mentor Program, and fostering connections with fellow security professionals either at the event or at one of our various networking receptions.<br>
    <br>
    As an added bonus, you can level up on your education by taking advantage of one of our SEVEN hands on training options*, available for one, two, and three days from September 23-25. *Training and conference require two separate ticket purchases.<br>
