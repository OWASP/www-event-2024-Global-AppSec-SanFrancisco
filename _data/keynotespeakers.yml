#        Simon Bennetts released OWASP ZAP in 2010 and since then has shepherded it to become the world's most popular web vulnerability scanner.
#        He is very active in OWASP and sits on the OWASP Project Committee. He has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, 
#        including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA & AsiaPac. Prior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years 
#        and strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.
#   subject: OWASP - Whats the Point?
#   abstract: >-
#         Is OWASP Still Relevant?
#         Do people want to go to conferences and chapter meetings in the aftermath of COVID?
#         Do we need 260+ projects?
#         Does anyone get past the titles of the Top 10?
#         In this talk Simon will explain why he thinks OWASP is still very relevant and a much needed force for good.
#         But this will be interactive and you will get a chance to have your say!
